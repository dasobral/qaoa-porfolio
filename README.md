# QAOA Portfolio Optimizer

A high-performance implementation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for portfolio optimization problems, demonstrating quantum-inspired solutions for real-world financial applications.

## üéØ Overview
This project showcases how quantum-inspired algorithms can solve complex portfolio optimization problems that are challenging for classical methods. By implementing QAOA with classical simulation, we bridge the gap between current optimization capabilities and future quantum computing advantages.

## Quick Start
Prerequisites
```bash
# For Rust implementation
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# For Python quantum backend
python -m pip install pennylane numpy pandas matplotlib yfinance
```

Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/qaoa-portfolio.git
cd qaoa-portfolio

# Build classical core (Rust example)
cd core && cargo build --release

# Install Python components
cd ../python && pip install -e .
```
