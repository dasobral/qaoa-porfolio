# QAOA Portfolio Optimizer (QOPO)

A high-performance implementation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for portfolio optimization problems, demonstrating quantum-inspired solutions for real-world financial applications.

## üéØ Overview

This project showcases how quantum-inspired algorithms can solve complex portfolio optimization problems that are challenging for classical methods. By implementing QAOA with classical simulation, we bridge the gap between current optimization capabilities and future quantum computing advantages.

## Quick Start

### Environment Setup

It is strongly recommended to work within a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with system packages.

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv qaoa-env
source qaoa-env/bin/activate  

# On Windows: qaoa-env\Scripts\activate

# Upgrade pip and install build tools
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### Prerequisites

```bash
# For Rust implementation
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# For Python quantum backend and market data components
pip install pennylane numpy pandas matplotlib yfinance
pip install pytest black flake8 jupyter ipykernel
```

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/qaoa-portfolio.git
cd qaoa-portfolio

# Build classical core (Rust)
cargo build --release

# Install Python components in development mode
cd python && pip install -e .
```

## Current Implementation Status

The QAOA Portfolio Optimizer is currently in active development with the following components implemented:

### ‚úÖ Market Data Loader (Completed)

**Status:** Production-ready

- Yahoo Finance integration (100% free, no API keys required)
- Async data loading with performance monitoring
- Comprehensive data validation (dual-level: per-asset + portfolio-wide)
- Smart caching system with configurable duration
- Support for stocks, cryptocurrencies, and mixed portfolios
- Configuration-driven behavior with free-tier optimization

**Features:**

- `MarketDataLoader` class for async data loading
- Portfolio utilities for stocks, crypto, and mixed assets
